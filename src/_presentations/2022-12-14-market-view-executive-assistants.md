In the role of executive assistant, knowledge is power. In this December 14, 2022, recording from the NAIS Webinar Series for Executive Assistants and Support Staff, you’ll learn about two data tools that will help you take on more high-level administrative responsibilities beyond your day-to-day tasks. Pull data reports relevant to discussions happening at your school with Data and Analysis for School Leadership (DASL) and Market View. Harnessing the ability to pull this data is a huge asset to your leadership team.

Presenters: Erica Zematis, NAIS Special Assistant to the President’s Office; Stephanie Wilkinson, NAIS Senior Director of Engineering; and Joy Bodycomb, NAIS Director of Data Quality and integration
