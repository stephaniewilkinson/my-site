Last night, [Ruby in Hollywood](https://twitter.com/rubyinhollywood) held a special event in conjunction with the [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly) Alumni Guild.

&nbsp;

We had a great mix of aspiring and current Rubyists, along with a good representation of General Assembly Grads from Cohort 9. We kicked off the evening with pizza and beer, and some good conversation.

## Using Docker in Production for Fun and Profit
#### [Rob Wilkinson](https://twitter.com/RobAWilkinson)

Next up, Rob Wilkinson, CTO of [Oddball.io](http://oddball.io/) gave a fantastic presentation about using Docker. He explained that it's a great way to manage deployment of apps as a team. He walked us through deployment, management, and setting up a Dockerfile.

## Everybody Get Flexy!
#### [Rouzbeh Sarrafieh](https://twitter.com/rouzbeh84)

&nbsp;

Rouzbeh repped front-end devs with a well-paced introduction to Flexbox. He showed us all of the benefits flexbox affords without relying on css frameworks.

## HTTP in Rubyland
#### [Shannon Skipper](https://twitter.com/_havenn)

Then [Shannon Skipper](https://twitter.com/_havenn), Lead Engineer at The Industry, took the stage. He walked us through the difference between various rack webservers and made a convincing argument for using [Roda](http://roda.jeremyevans.net/) for a ruby framework that is quick, light, and handles requests efficiently.
