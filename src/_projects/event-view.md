<ins>[NAIS Event View](https://events.nais.org) </ins> is an Elixir LiveView application developed for users to register groups for events, which launched in 2022.

Previously, invitees had to be added during the checkout process, which was problematic when the inviter didn't know who to invite at the time of purchase. With Event View, people buy the event first, then use a link to invite their teammates via the app.

The application consists of three screens and sends informational emails to attendees via Intercom. It is primarily designed for team-based registrations and currently doesn't support e-commerce features or individual registrations. Event View also features an embedded chat widget for user support, powered by Intercom.
