I love lifting weights, but I didn't like any of the lift tracking apps available. I wanted something simple that you could use at the gym to track your plates and quickly repeat workouts.

I'm building an app, <ins>[Tectonic Plates](https://tectonicplates.app)</ins>,  to solve this problem. It's a work in progress. I've implemented Rodauth for logins and tokens, tailwind for CSS, and next I want to add charting for keeping track of progress.

My three year old daughter is helping with the design.
