Bodytemp was a mobile app I built as my capstone project for General Assembly. Its purpose was to allow the user to track their basal body temperature every day, in order to chart fertility and prevent/plan pregnancy. 

&nbsp;

[Here's an explanation](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/fertility-awareness/whats-temperature-method-fams) from Planned Parenthood on this particular birth control method.

&nbsp;

I used Charts.js to create the temperature charts and calendars, and a CRUD interface for users entering and updating temperatures. 

&nbsp;

I had lots of fun presenting this app and discussing birth control with my all-male cohort of developers.(!)

[Check out the code and screengrabs here](https://github.com/stephaniewilkinson/bodytemp-ionic/). I never released this to an app store, it stayed as a proof of concept.
